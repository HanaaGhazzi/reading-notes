## Markdown

**Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.**

> *A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.*


### Headings
*To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).*
  
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3


### Bold
To bold text, add two ( ** ) or ( __ ) before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis

**BOLD**


### _Italic_

To italicize text, add one ( * ) or ( _ )  before and after a word or phrase.

 _ITALIC_ 
 
 

### LINK
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses

my favorite social media network is [Facebook](https://ar-ar.facebook.com/)



### LISTS
You can nest an unordered list in an ordered list, or vice versa.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
  - Indented item
  - Indented item
4. Fourth item


### Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." -Nelson Mandela

> “Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration,” said Thomas Edison.



```
In one world, effort is a bad thing. It like failure, means you’re not smart or talented. 
If you were, you wouldn’t need effort.
In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented.

The brain is like a muscle that needs to be worked out, just like the body.

Use the word “yet.”

```
