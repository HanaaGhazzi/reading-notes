## Markdown

**Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.**

> *A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like itâ€™s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.*


### Headings
*To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).*
  
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3


### Bold
To bold text, add two ( ** ) or ( __ ) before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis

**BOLD**


### _Italic_

To italicize text, add one ( * ) or ( _ )  before and after a word or phrase.

 _ITALIC_ 
 
 

### LINK
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses

my favorite social media network is [Facebook](https://ar-ar.facebook.com/)



### LISTs
You can nest an unordered list in an ordered list, or vice versa.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
  - Indented item
  - Indented item
4. Fourth item


### Blockquotes

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

> "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." -Nelson Mandela
