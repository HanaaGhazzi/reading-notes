### Workflow

## Local Repository Structure

## Saving Changes

All files in a checked out (or working) copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.

__*Tracked*__

Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.

__*Untracked*__

Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.

> After cloning a repository, files have tracked status and are unmodified because they have been checked out but not edited.

## The Life Cycle of File Status

1. After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified because of changes made after the previous commit.
2. You stage the modified file.
3. Then, you commit staged changes.
