```
In one world, effort is a bad thing. It like failure, means you’re not smart or talented. 
If you were, you wouldn’t need effort.
In the other world, effort is what makes you smart or talented.

The brain is like a muscle that needs to be worked out, just like the body.

Use the word “yet.”

```
