# COLOR 

__The Material Design color system can help you create a color theme that reflects your brand or style.__


## What is color?
> Color originates from a light source, that is either view directly or as reflected light. Daylight or white light contains light waves for all colors. There is no color with out light! The absence of light is complete darkness or black. The mixture of all visible light is white light. White light is made up of all the colors in the rainbow. Water droplets in the air act like a prism does when light passes through. It organizes random color light waves into the order of their wave length. We see that organized pattern as a rainbow. These colors are always in the same order and are called the Color Spectrum. When organized in order around a circle; the colorspectrum is called a Color Wheel.

## There are 3 primary ways to describe a color:

- Hue — another word for color

- Saturation (chroma) — the intensity or purity of a hue

- Lightness (value) — the relative degree of black or white mixed with a given hue



## How Does CSS Work?

_CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page In this case, “p” (the paragraph) is called the “selector”—it’s the part of CSS code specifying which HTML element the CSS styling will effect. In CSS, the selector is written to the left of the first curly bracket. The information between curly brackets is called a declaration, and it contains properties and values that are applied to the selector. Properties are things like font size, color, and margins, while values are the settings for those properties. In the example above, “color” and “font-weight” are both properties, and “pink” and “bold”are values. The full bracketed set of_

{  **color:pink**;  **font-weight:bold**;  } 

_is the declaration, and again, “p” (meaning the HTML paragraph) is the selector. These same basic principles can be applied to change font sizes, background colors, margin indentations, and more. For instance. . ._

body  {  **background-color:lightblue;**  }
_. . .would make your page’s background light blue, or. . ._

p  {  **font-size:20px;  color:red;**  }
_. . .will create a 20 point font paragraph with red letters._
