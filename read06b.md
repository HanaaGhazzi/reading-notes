# HOW DOES A COMPUTER WORK?


## What makes a computer a computer?
*There are basic building blocks to a computer, which, like Lego bricks, can be combined in billions of different ways to make loads of different things. But unlike Lego, these building blocks don’t have to look the same. They could be links on a chain or mechanical gears or pulses of electricity. What they have in common is that they respond to different inputs in different ways*

## Binary manipulation
*As you may know, computers take in and give out information in a code called binary. Binary form allows any number to be represented as an arrangement of just two signals which we call **0 and 1**. Different types of computers represent 0s and 1s differently: modern computers use a strong electrical pulse for 1 and a weaker one for zero. A billiard ball computer would use a billiard ball as a 1 and the absence of a ball as a zero. However it is represented, each digit within a binary number is called a ‘binary digit’ or ‘bit’.*

## Logic Circuits

*A logic circuit is a circuit that executes a processing or controlling function in a computer.  This circuit implements logical operations on information to process it.*

*Logic circuits utilise two values for a given physical quantity (voltage, for example) to denote the Boolean values true and false or 1 and 0 respectively.  Logic circuits have inputs, as well as having outputs which can be dependent on the inputs.  In logic circuit diagrams, connection from one circuit’s output to another circuit’s input is displayed as an arrowhead at the input end.*

*When it comes to performance, logic circuits are similar to programming language functions.  The inputs are similar to function parameters while the outputs are similar to function returned values.  A logic circuit can accommodate multiple outputs.*

### Two Types of Logic Circuitry:

- Combinational circuitry – operates like a simple function. The output is based on the present values of the input.
- State circuitry – this kind of gate performs like an object method. The output is not only based on the input.  It is also based on the historical inputs.  This is made possible by the memory embedded in the circuitry.

## CPU, Memory, Input & Output:

## Hardware vs. Software

- **Hardware** :is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer's internal parts.

- **Software** :is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors.

_Everything you do on your computer will rely on both hardware and software. For example, right now you may be viewing this lesson in a web browser (software) and using your mouse (hardware) to click from page to page._
