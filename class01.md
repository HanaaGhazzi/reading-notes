### Advantages of JavaScript

- The merits of using JavaScript are:

    1. **Less server interaction** − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.

    2. **Immediate feedback to the visitors** − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

    3. **Increased interactivity** − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

    4. **Richer interfaces** − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.
