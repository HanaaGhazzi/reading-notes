# What, How, When JavaScript? 

_JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)_

## A Scribt ? 
> a script is just a series of short
instructions, each of which is performed in order
to solve the problem in hand

### Writing A Scribt : 

- **DEFINE THE GOAL**

- **DESIGN THE SCRIPT**

- **CODE EACH STEP**


 **_A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm. A flowchart can be helpful for both writing programs and explaining the program to others._**

*To be programer you need to learn language, Just like learning any new language, you need to get to grips with the:*

- **Vocabulary**: The words that computers
understand
- **Syntax**: How you put those words together to
create instructions computers can follow

**Simple expressions**
A simple expression is a literal, variable name, or method call. No operators are involved.

**Compound expressions**
A compound expression consists of one or more simple expressions integrated into a larger expression via an operator, which is a sequence of instructions symbolically represented in source code. 

### Operators

## Function:

 *is a block of code which only runs when it is called.*

*functions are used to perform certain actions*

**Why use functions ? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.**
