## PROCESS & Design

- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
